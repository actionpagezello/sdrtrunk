# SDRTrunk AP Features - Session Status

> NOTE: CLAUDE.md (repo root, gitignored) is the primary session context file and is kept

## Current Release: ap-15.7 (2026-08-01)
- GitHub release: https://github.com/actionpagezello/sdrtrunk/releases/tag/v0.6.2-ap-15.7
- Zip: `C:\Users\Admin\projects\sdrtrunk-ap-versions\v0.6.2-ap-15.7\sdr-trunk-windows-x86_64-v0.6.2-ap-15.7.zip`
- Deployed: not yet — Somerville and Stoneham still on ap-15.6

## GitHub
- Fork: https://github.com/actionpagezello/sdrtrunk
- Master branch has all features integrated
- Content-synced with upstream DSheirer/sdrtrunk master as of 2026-08-01 (through e2d9c4c)

## Build Environment
- JDK 25 (Bellsoft Liberica), Gradle 9.2, JavaFX, Windows 11
- Gradle now autoprovisions the JDK (foojay resolver + BELLSOFT vendor spec, upstream #2427)
- Repo path: C:\Users\Admin\projects\sdrtrunk-ap
- Build command: `.\gradlew runtimeZipCurrent`
- Version property: `gradle.properties` -> `projectVersion=0.6.2-ap-15.7`
- 10GB heap (`-Xmx10g` in build.gradle jvmArgsWindows and jvmArgsLinux)

## Changes in ap-15.7
See CHANGELOG.md for full details.
1. **Zello "audio data sent too fast"/"bad mid" → transient** — no longer wedge channels in
   terminal Configuration Error; stream state resets with backoff (root cause of manual
   restarts during ap-15.6 soak).
2. **Paced pending-frame flush** — 8-frame burst + 55ms/frame drain replaces the unpaced
   burst that drew server stream kills; bounded tail burst at stream stop.
3. **Pending-frame cap 15 → 30** — stops eviction of start-of-call audio (~11% of starts).
4. **Pending-stop timeout log WARN → DEBUG** — was ~53k log lines per 3 days.
5. **Upstream ports** — SampleNativeBuffer SIMD fix (#2398), 43 new DCS codes (#2424),
   NXDN radio reference editor (#2446, manual merge), NXDN talker alias log removal (#2442),
   playlist name sorting (#2342), Gradle JVM autoprovisioning (#2427).

## Completed Features
1. CTCSS channel-level filtering (full squelch, Goertzel detector)
2. DCS channel-level filtering (full squelch, 134.4 bps slope decoder via DCSDetector.java wrapper)
3. NAC channel-level filtering (P25 built-in, already existed)
4. CTCSS aux decoder toggle in Additional Decoders (added to DecoderType.AUX_DECODERS)
5. CTCSS/DCS/NAC alias identifiers (AliasItemEditor + IdentifierEditorFactory)
6. Squelch tail/head removal (SquelchTailRemover wired into NBFMDecoder)
7. Tone Filter UI pane in NBFMConfigurationEditor
8. Mute/Unmute right-click + Show in Waterfall (16x zoom)
9. Live alias editor refresh via AliasPriorityChangedEvent
10. Zello Work + Zello Consumer real-time streaming (Opus over WebSocket)
11. Column width/order persistence (JTableColumnWidthMonitor)
12. Alias list alphabetical sorting (FXCollections.sort in AliasModel)
13. Diagnostics preferences panel with per-category DEBUG toggles
14. FxTableColumnMonitor for Channels editor column/sort persistence
15. CTCSS/DCS/NAC auto-import from Radio Reference tone field (FrequencyEditor)
16. NXDN decoder (upstream merge, ap-15) + NXDN radio reference import (ap-15.7)

## Key Zello File Paths
- AbstractZelloBroadcaster.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (shared base, paced flush, watchdog)
- ZelloProtocolUtil.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (constants + transient error classification)
- ZelloChannelConfiguration.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (shared config interface)
- ZelloBroadcaster.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (Work — thin subclass)
- ZelloConsumerBroadcaster.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (Consumer — thin subclass)
- ZelloSharedConnection.java -> audio/broadcast/zello/ (shared WebSocket pool)
- BroadcastModel.java -> audio/broadcast/ (staggered broadcaster startup + reconnect)

## Test Commands
```
.\gradlew test --tests "io.github.dsheirer.audio.broadcast.zello.*"
.\gradlew runtimeZipCurrent
```

## IMPORTANT: ChannelMetadataPanel path
The correct path is `channel/metadata/ChannelMetadataPanel.java` (package `io.github.dsheirer.channel.metadata`).
It was incorrectly copied to `gui/channel/` in ap-06 which caused mute/unmute and channel names to not work.
Fixed in ap-07. The wrong file at `gui/channel/` was deleted.
