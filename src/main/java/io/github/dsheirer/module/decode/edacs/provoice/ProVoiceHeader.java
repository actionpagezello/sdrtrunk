/**
 * AP-fork (edacs-17): reads the header a ProVoice transmission starts with.
 *
 * The header is one block sent over and over for 0.3 to 0.5 seconds: a 64-bit sync and then a 48-bit word sent three
 * times - the word, the word inverted, the word again - which is how EDACS sends its control channel messages too.
 * A frame of the voice channel holds three of those triples, at bits {@link #TRIPLES} after the frame sync.
 *
 * The word is 36 data bits followed by 12 check bits of the same BCH code the control channel uses
 * ({@link EDACSBCH}).  Its data starts with {@link #HEADER_ID} and holds the talkgroup the transmission is for in
 * bits 14 to 29.  Measured on MBTA 2026-11-12, both sites: the talkgroup of the header is the talkgroup the
 * control channel assigned the call to in 68 of 68 recorded calls.  The six data bits after the talkgroup change
 * with the talkgroup and are not understood; the calling radio is not in the word.
 *
 * A frame is a header only when the three copies of a word agree, its check bits are right and it starts with the
 * header value, so voice is not taken for a header: in the 71 calls recorded that day the 282 frames that read as
 * one are all in the first six frames of a transmission, or at the start of the one transmission that followed
 * another without a gap - none is inside the voice.  A header that does not have this layout - another system
 * type - is not recognized here and is left to {@link ProVoiceHeaderDetector}, as before.
