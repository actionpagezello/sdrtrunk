/**
 * AP-fork (edacs-15): tells the frames at the start of a ProVoice transmission that are not voice from the voice.
 *
 * A ProVoice transmission does not start with voice.  It starts with a header frame sent three to five times over,
 * bit for bit the same, then one or two more frames of other data, and only then voice - 0.3 to 0.6 seconds in all
 * (MBTA LCN 5, recorded 2026-11-09: 26 of 27 transmissions, median 0.48 s).  Every one of those frames has the
 * voice sync in front, so until this the decoder treated them as voice.  Read as voice they are noise: most of
 * their four 20 ms voice frames fail the error check and were silenced, but about one in seven passed it by chance
 * and was played, and then repeated by the concealment.  That was the burst of digital noise at the start of calls,
 * and it is why 60% of the first 0.48 s was reported damaged at every site whatever the reception.
 *
 * Nothing here knows the layout of the header; it is recognized by how it behaves:
 * - a frame that repeats the frame before it (voice never does - two voice frames in a row share about 65% of
 *   their bits, a repeated header 100%) is header, and so is the one it repeats;
 * - once a header has been seen, the frames that follow are header until one arrives that reads as voice, which is
 *   at least {@link #VOICE_FRAMES_NEEDED} of its four voice frames passing the error check;
 * - the first frame of a transmission has nothing to be compared with, so it is played only if it reads as clean
 *   voice ({@link #FIRST_FRAME_MAX_ERRORS} errors at most) - which is the case when the channel joins a
 *   transmission that is already in voice.
 * All of this applies to the first {@link #WINDOW_FRAMES} frames of a transmission only.  After that every frame is
 * voice, as before.
 *
 * Not thread safe.
